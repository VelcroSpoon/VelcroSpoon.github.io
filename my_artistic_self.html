            <p>I believe this painting reflects me relatively well as I enjoy the peace and quiet you experience at night while you watch the stars. This may seem like I enjoy nature fully but that's not completely true as I still appreciate signs of civilisation as you can see in the painting picturing a port. Something about that middle ground is great to me. 
              I am passionate about certain topics and believe to be a very ambitious person with many plans in mind. Although I struggle to accomplish them sometimes, I try my best to stay true to myself and complete as many goals in life as I can, after all life is short. 
              In a similar manner, I'm a curious person as I love to learn about most things, the world is filled with plenty of mysteries and questions that have yet to be answered. 
              I've only recently rediscovered my curious side as I went through a rough time previously but since I've gotten better, I've been rediscovering myself again slowly. Improvement has been a life changing aspect of my life. As mentioned previously I've been struggling mentally as I was not exactly where I was supposed to be. I've always had a hard time accepting myself and now it's definitely gotten better. Reading books about how to get better habits or how to simply be a better person everyday helps a lot to feel more fulfilled about myself and believe that I'm not simply not making any progress in life. I believe the past 2 to 3 years have been the most progress I've made as a person and I'm proud of it.
              Now serenity, I love the peace and quiet you can find in nature, especially at night. I love to go for walks at night and just admire the stars and the calmness that comes with it. It's a great way to clear your mind and relax. 
              Lastly, dogs. I had 2 dogs growing up. One of them passed away last year but i still love them both dearly. Dogs are great friends and help you understand that sometimes life being simple is fine. I love making my dogs happy by taking them on walks as much as possible or giving them out treats. My dogs would walk for the whole day if they could. I love them both so much and they are definitely a big part of my life.
