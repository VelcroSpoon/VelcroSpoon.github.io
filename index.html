      <h1>Hi, my name is Simon Grondin.</h1>

      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>- I'm a second-year computer science student at Bishop's University. I've been loving it so far as Bishop's has given me plenty of opportunities to meet new people and maintain those connections with the close campus setting. Living far from home also allows you to grow in a way you could never have imagined before.</p>
      <p>- I'm from Ottawa but I've lived in different cities throughout my life, for example I was born in Montreal but we moved to Vancouver for about a year or two. We then moved back in the province of Quebec near Trois-Riviere. Before I started kindergarten, we finally moved to Ottawa, which is where I've been living for the past 17 years or so. Now i'm discovering a new city by coming to Sherbrooke and enjoying a different environment the school has to offer.</p>
      <p>- Currently working towards building a company in hopes of getting financial freedom one day.</p>
